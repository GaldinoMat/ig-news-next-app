# ig-news-next-app

This is the last project built by Rocketseat's Ignite bootcamp. It uses Prismic CMS as a headless content manager, faunadb as a way to handle users and stripe as a payment gateway to subscribers.
The entire site uses the SSR strategy provided by the NEXTJS framework, as well as OAUTH2 by Github.
